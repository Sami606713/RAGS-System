Summary : This figure presents a heatmap showing the sensitivity of LCOE-fuel (Levelized Cost of Energy for fuel) to changes in Capex (capital expenditure) and LCOE, with a colour scale indicating LCOE-fuel values.

heatmap:
# Title & Axes :
  • Title: "LCOE-fuel Sensitivity to Capex and LCOE Changes".
  • X-axis: "Capex Change (%)", ranging from -20 to 20.
  • Y-axis: "LCOE Change (%)", ranging from -20 to 20.
  • Colour bar at right labelled "LCOE-fuel (€/l)", ranging from 2.56 to 3.68.

# Data Points :
  • Each cell in the grid represents a combination of Capex Change (%) and LCOE Change (%).
  • The colour of each cell encodes the corresponding LCOE-fuel value (€/l), with lighter colours for lower values and darker colours for higher values.

# Design Encodings :
  • Colour gradient from red (low LCOE-fuel) through yellow to blue (high LCOE-fuel).
  • Diagonal bands of colour indicate how LCOE-fuel changes with the two variables.
  • No markers or grid lines; smooth colour transitions.

# Distribution & Trends :
  • LCOE-fuel values increase as both Capex Change (%) and LCOE Change (%) increase.
  • The lowest LCOE-fuel values (red) are at the bottom left (low Capex and LCOE changes).
  • The highest LCOE-fuel values (blue) are at the top right (high Capex and LCOE changes).
  • The colour bands run diagonally from bottom left to top right, indicating a combined effect.

# Analysis :
  • LCOE-fuel is most sensitive to simultaneous increases in both Capex and LCOE, resulting in higher costs.
  • Reducing either Capex or LCOE (or both) leads to lower LCOE-fuel values.
  • The relationship appears linear and additive, with no visible anomalies or non-monotonic regions. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.851,t=0.546,r=0.990,b=0.758), with ID 2672d6d9-ebf5-4dcb-8525-741122afe885 -->
