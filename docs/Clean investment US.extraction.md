Summary : This stacked bar chart shows annual global investment in clean energy sectors from 2015 to 2023, measured in billion USD (2022). It breaks down total investment by sector, including renewable power, energy efficiency, other end use, grids, electric vehicles, battery storage, nuclear, and low-emission fuels and carbon capture utilisation and storage.

bar chart:
# Title & Axes :
  • Title: "Annual clean energy investment, 2015-2023"
  • Y-axis: "billion USD (2022)", range from 0 to 2000, with gridlines at 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, 2000.
  • X-axis: Years from 2015 to 2023 (inclusive), one bar per year.

# Data Points :
  • For each year (2015–2023), the total investment is divided into the following sectors (from bottom to top in each bar):
    – Renewable power
    – Energy efficiency
    – Other end use
    – Grids
    – Electric vehicle
    – Battery storage
    – Nuclear
    – Low-emission fuels and carbon capture utilisation and storage
  • Investment values are not individually labeled on the chart, but the total height of the bars increases from just above 1000 billion USD in 2015 to over 1750 billion USD in 2023.

# Design Encodings :
  • Stacked bar chart: Each sector is represented by a distinct color.
  • Color legend at the bottom:
    – Renewable power (light blue)
    – Energy efficiency (blue)
    – Other end use (green)
    – Grids (teal)
    – Electric vehicle (yellow)
    – Battery storage (orange)
    – Nuclear (red)
    – Low-emission fuels and carbon capture utilisation and storage (purple)
  • No error bars or confidence intervals shown.

# Distribution & Trends :
  • The total annual investment increases steadily from 2015 to 2023.
  • The largest segments are renewable power, energy efficiency, and grids.
  • Electric vehicles and battery storage show notable growth in the later years (2021–2023).
  • Nuclear and low-emission fuels/carbon capture remain small segments throughout.

# Analysis :
  • Global clean energy investment has grown consistently from 2015 to 2023, with the most rapid increases occurring after 2020.
  • Renewable power, energy efficiency, and grids dominate total investment, but electric vehicles and battery storage have accelerated sharply in recent years.
  • Nuclear and low-emission fuels/carbon capture remain minor contributors to total investment.
  • The data suggests a broadening of investment focus, with emerging technologies (EVs, battery storage) gaining share alongside traditional sectors. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.067,t=0.218,r=0.921,b=0.803), with ID 7248a944-c386-405e-9010-713b4db3d768 -->
