Abstract

The emissions from transportation have been increasing rapidly in the last decade, accounting for second highest greenhouse gas emissions in energy sector. Replacing crude oil-based fuels with biofuels derived from bio-based feedstocks can significantly reduce the carbon footprint and environmental impact of transportation. In comparison to other forms of renewable energy, biofuels would require relatively less infrastructure investment. This study conducts a comprehensive analysis of the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) and evaluates the environmental impact of producing bioethanol from various agricultural and waste feedstocks that are available globally. Procedures used for the collection of LCI data and the selection of Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods are outlined. The results from the global LCIA indicate that waste-based feedstocks have the least impact. Using second-generation feedstocks can enhance organic and municipal solid waste management while accounting for the food-versus-fuel challenge faced by the industry. It is shown that in comparison to agriculture-based feedstocks, organic solid waste feedstocks require less material consumption and land use for bioethanol production. By utilizing the most commonly available waste as feedstocks, this study provides a sustainable and global solution to reduce emissions in the transportation sector. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.059,t=0.384,r=0.943,b=0.536), with ID 9582d61e-5402-4fab-8607-9252ccde84c6 -->

1. Introduction

    According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report [1], the sectors of agriculture & other land use along with transportation contribute a significant portion of global greenhouse gas emissions. Owing to the high emissions, the agriculture sector has been under pressure to sustainably feed the growing population around the globe. While the yields from agriculture are increasing, the waste also increases relatively [2]. There is a growing interest globally to move towards sustainable sources of energy to address the overall challenge of climate change [3]. In the past few years, significant progress has been made in transitioning towards cleaner fuels in the transportation sector. However, despite the growing trend in electric-powered <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.052,t=0.619,r=0.497,b=0.823), with ID 3dc24eed-eebf-4bde-9fd0-d91455758300 -->

modes of transport, a few sections of transportation sectors,
especially the aviation industry, are still lagging in the clean
energy transition. Moreover, due to limited fossil fuel reserves,
conventional crude oil-based fuels are likely to deplete rapidly. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.504,t=0.622,r=0.947,b=0.679), with ID e3483fed-4bf4-483a-a35b-4c1350abe0dd -->

The use of biofuels can reduce the carbon footprints of both the agriculture and transportation sectors. This work discusses the Life Cycle Impact of various waste and lignocellulosic feedstocks to produce bioethanol from cradle to gate (feedstock acquisition to ethanol production). A comparative study is carried out to examine the relative impacts of different feedstocks on the production of bioethanol in comparison with the use of corn as a feedstock. This bioethanol can be blended with gasoline for road transportation or can be processed into biojet or biodiesel for application in energy-intensive vehicles. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.504,t=0.679,r=0.947,b=0.821), with ID bf55851b-cbee-4747-b3c0-327ec2d89154 -->

2. Motivation

    United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) estimated that there is enough crop residue available globally to produce around 50 billion tons of oil [4]. However, if solid waste is not managed properly, it may cause severe impacts on the environment and human health. To find a better solution there is increasing interest in utilizing lignocellulose-based agricultural waste as a feedstock. The most common approaches are the production of biofuels and enzymes for industrial applications [5]. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.060,t=0.292,r=0.492,b=0.450), with ID ddd9fdd0-5986-4e50-9c06-f7dc39521486 -->

The biomass feedstocks to produce biofuels are can be classified broadly into three types: first-generation (1G), second-generation (2G), and third-generation (3G) which are edible sources (food crops), inedible sources (non-food crops), and cultivated sources (aquatic crops) respectively [6]–[8]. Alternatively, Rodionova et al. [9] and Algayyim et al. [10] classified biofuels into primary and secondary biofuels. Primary biofuels are produced from biomass that is used as fuel without any modifications (e.g., wood chips and, grass) that can directly produce energy by burning. Secondary biofuels consist of 1G, 2G, and 3G biofuels which are produced from food crops, lignocellulosic biomass, and algae respectively. The fourth-generation (4G) biomass is genetically engineered (to have increased oil concentrations, improved production, extraction, and fermentation processes while increasing the potential to capture carbon) and is still at the experimental stage in the laboratory and is developed as a modification of algae [11]. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.060,t=0.452,r=0.492,b=0.706), with ID 244d5012-b020-4a7e-a504-4e1a9b5ddce0 -->

The fuels produced from 1G feedstocks were found to have a higher impact on the environment compared to the other generations. Hence, there is active research to explore more 2G and 3G feedstocks with lower carbon footprint [12], [13]. To cultivate the same amount of product, 1G feedstock requires more land compared to 2G and 3G feedstocks. Besides, as 1G feedstocks are generally derived from edible biomass, its production often presents a food-versus-fuel dilemma. Contrarily, 2G and 3G feedstocks are based on a wide range of sources, including agriculture waste and algae that are considered carbon neutral or even carbon negative (in some cases where carbon dioxide itself is consumed by the feedstock [14]). Hence, to reduce the overall environmental impacts, 2G and 3G feedstocks are preferred over 1G feedstocks. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.060,t=0.707,r=0.492,b=0.909), with ID fc73588d-1131-41e5-8049-a4007112c669 -->

Figure 1 shows the selected biofuels and their corresponding pathways for producing bioethanol. Corn is the most used biomass source (over 90% in the U.S. market) as it belongs to the first generation of biofuel feedstocks [15], [16]. Any source that can be edible by humans or animals is considered a first-generation biofuel. The rest of the selected biofuels are considered second-generation biofuels since they are derived from other non-edible cellulosic biomass sources. Excepting municipal solid waste (MSW)-fluff, all the selected biofuels in Figure 1 are produced in the field; Once harvested, they are then preprocessed and delivered to a storage facility; and finally, they are transported to a refinery facility to be converted to ethanol and other co-products. The following subsections describe each biofuel source. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.511,t=0.314,r=0.943,b=0.517), with ID b73957d6-e378-41ad-a069-378317a299ec -->

*3.1. Corn*

The production of corn consists of preparing the field and planting its seeds. A combination of different tillage operations (intensive, reduced, minimum) is needed to prepare the soil for planting the seeds. Fertilizers are needed to supply nutrients to soil and plants. Pesticides may also be needed to eliminate any organisms harmful to the product. While growing, plants transform atmospheric carbon dioxide into energy-containing hydrocarbons by absorbing it. A single-pass harvesting operation is executed once the plantations are ready for harvesting. Once harvested, the corn is then separated from the stover and transported to a storage facility for drying, grinding, and storing. Finally, it is delivered to a dry mill facility for its conversion to ethanol. Apart from ethanol, distillers dried grain with solubles (DDGS) is also produced as a merchandisable co-product. 1 kg of DDGS may substitute 0.947 kg of corn grain, 0.303 kg of soybean meal, and 0.025 kg of urea for energy generation [17]. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.510,t=0.529,r=0.943,b=0.803), with ID 39527402-12f2-475b-ba7e-d8c11bd07529 -->

*3.2. Corn Stover*

Corn stover is a by-product of corn production and 31.5% of the harvested corn ends up in the stover. After the corn is separated, the stover is baled before transporting to the storage facility and then dried, ground, and stored. Finally, the stover is transported to a biorefinery facility for biochemical conversion to ethanol [17]. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.511,t=0.814,r=0.942,b=0.932), with ID 79cf0a9d-6088-4bc5-9b24-c3946f77f397 -->

3.3. Forest Residue

    The targeted forest residue in this study is the losses from logging timber trees. Around 21% of the total timber trees volume is recovered as residue and is transported to a storage facility (30% of cut tree mass become residue, and 70% of this residue remains after skidding losses). The residues are assumed to be already chipped, so no preprocessing is needed. Finally, the residues are transported to a biorefinery facility for their thermochemical conversion to ethanol. This thermochemical conversion process is done via indirect gasification and mixed alcohol synthesis processes. Other than ethanol, the latter process also produces mixed alcohols and sulfur as merchandisable co-products [17]. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.059,t=0.082,r=0.490,b=0.285), with ID 924e753c-3f86-47f6-a2e2-d9ce297a01f0 -->

3.4. Switchgrass

Similar to corn grain, the production of switchgrass requires tillage operations, planting, irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application to the soils and grass. Again, carbon dioxide and biomass energy are collected from nature. For harvesting, mowing and collection operations are conducted. Then, the switchgrass is baled and transported to a storage facility for their drying, grinding, and storing. Finally, switchgrass is transported to a biorefinery facility for its biochemical conversion to ethanol [17]. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.060,t=0.297,r=0.490,b=0.456), with ID f52ccb9e-df9e-4cfb-bf6b-17d5ba7f0c79 -->

3.5. Wheat Straw

    Similar to the aforementioned feedstocks, the production of wheat straw needs fertilization and the harvesting process. Then, it is baled and transported to a storage facility where it is dried, ground, and stored. Finally, the wheat straw is transported to a biorefinery facility for its biochemical conversion to ethanol. This biochemical conversion process is similar to corn stover and switchgrass. The main processes are diluted acid pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation processes [17]. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.060,t=0.468,r=0.491,b=0.627), with ID f934f709-50ea-42ac-b492-e5477cec9fde -->

*3.6. MSW-Fluff*

The production of MSW-fluff is held in the landfill facility. First, MSW is collected and hauled to the landfill facility. Diesel fuel is consumed by the trucks performing these two processes. Then, MSW is sorted to recover valuable metals, glass materials, and plastics. The resulting residues are termed MSW-fluff. Electricity is needed to perform all the sorting processing. If MSW-fluff is further processed apart from the landfill facility, then it is transported to a conversion facility to perform the following steps: shredding and separation, cellulose hydrolysis, solid-liquid separation and flash distillation via a gravity pressure vessel (GPV), and fermentation. Other auxiliary steps are held to treat co-products and by-products. Among these products, it is important to highlight the capture of carbon dioxide [17]. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.059,t=0.639,r=0.490,b=0.871), with ID 5f572d09-244e-4c13-9a1e-9f081875ef32 -->

4. Comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.510,t=0.082,r=0.846,b=0.101), with ID 18a8b3f7-58d9-403d-8e5c-c2ea2c0decad -->

*4.1. Goal and scope definition*

The goal of this study is to conduct a comparative LCA of bioethanol production from cradle to gate (i.e., from biofuel sources to bioethanol production). Corn grain is the only selected first-generation feedstock whereas corn stover, forest residue, switchgrass, wheat straw, and MSW fluff are the selected second-generation feedstocks. There are two important reasons for choosing these feedstocks to produce bioethanol. The first one is to compare the environmental impacts between 1G and 2G biofuel sources. It is desired to avoid 1G biofuels due to the increased cost on the consumer for feeding humans and animals. 1G feedstock production also consumes more resources (water and energy) The second reason is that these 2G feedstocks are available worldwide, with some regions being more abundant than others. At the very least, they could help reduce the environmental footprint and reliance on gasoline in the transportation sector. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.510,t=0.112,r=0.941,b=0.369), with ID 3dad7b13-2677-4470-ad4b-dc33bd72d920 -->

Section 3 showed an overview of the process chain for each feedstock and a description of the process steps included in this LCA. The functional unit for each biofuel source scenario is the production of 1 kg of bioethanol. The biorefinery facilities considered in this study operate in generic locations to assume that they could be implemented in any country. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.512,t=0.370,r=0.940,b=0.455), with ID 93e31042-82e2-41e4-bec2-561701b8ad4e -->

There are co-products in some of the scenarios (corn grain, forest residue, MSW-fluff) alongside bioethanol production. To estimate the environmental impacts associated with bioethanol production, some substitution and allocation techniques are required to separate the impacts of other products. For MSW as feedstock, where there is a production of other co-products (electricity, heat, and water), hence, allocation through system expansion was carried out to account for the positive environmental impact of these co-products' production. Allocation through system expansion or substitution helps in accounting for the secondary functions of the co-products, especially if they add value to the process. The co-products are viewed as substitutes for other goods available on the global market. Allocation by economic value was also conducted for bioethanol production from MSW as there is a production of acetone and butanol as co-products. Economic allocation is helpful to isolate the sole impact of ethanol production from the impacts of other products that are cogenerated since physical factors (like weight or volume) cannot be used to quantify the environmental impacts of the different co-products obtained in the process. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.511,t=0.456,r=0.940,b=0.755), with ID 9f6ce931-a165-482e-87e6-c7c5ec1d7b07 -->

4.2. Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) Analysis

    The foreground data (specific data for the system that is being modeled) for this LCI are obtained from different studies from the literature [17], [18]. The background data (general data that is an indication of the industrial economy) is obtained by using the Ecoinvent v3.6 database. Most of the background data used in the literature was based on a specific location. However, as explained in the last subsection, the location for this study is modified to GLO (Global), so that the results are not location-dependent (i.e., The goal of this study is to analyze <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.510,t=0.769,r=0.940,b=0.927), with ID 04c3d4b5-1da8-40ed-9913-96dd25ccdb25 -->

*4.3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA)*

The LCIA method in this study is the IMPACT World+ Midpoint v1.02 for global impact assessment [19]. The assessment method considers the following 18 categories: climate change (short term and long term), photochemical oxidant formation, ozone layer depletion, freshwater and terrestrial acidification, freshwater and marine eutrophication, ionizing radiation, biodiversity (land transformation and land occupation), water scarcity, freshwater ecotoxicity, human toxicity (cancer and non-cancer), particulate matter formation, fossil and nuclear energy use, and mineral resources use. A characterization analysis is performed on the results of all six scenarios for comparing against each other by using a normalization technique with respect to the feedstock with the highest impact in each impact category to get the relative effect of each feedstock. The results of this LCIA are reported and discussed in the following section. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.059,t=0.141,r=0.491,b=0.401), with ID efe053ac-9ca5-4884-bf9d-384a9d72c0c6 -->

4.4. Results of LCIA

    A comparative Life Cycle Impact Assessment was conducted to analyze the absolute and relative impacts of the feedstocks discussed in section 3. Table 1 shows the results of the impact assessment of the 6 feedstocks: Corn, Wheat Straw, Switchgrass, Corn Stover, Forest Residue, and Municipal Solid Waste. 18 impact categories were analyzed, which are classified into ecosystem quality damage indicators, human health damage indicators, and resource depletion indicators. In Table 1, an indicator with a positive value presents a contribution to the corresponding impact category, while an indicator with a negative value implies an avoided impact. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.059,t=0.411,r=0.492,b=0.600), with ID d125c5d4-f7d1-4d41-9c12-b3c8211a0172 -->

Figure 2 shows the normalized contribution of all 6 feedstocks by dividing the individual impact by the highest value obtained in each category. It is an indication of the relative impact of each feedstock. It was observed that the first-generation feedstock, corn had the highest impact for all categories and all the other feedstocks had negligible impact compared to corn. MSW has a negative value for freshwater eutrophication and biodiversity indicators (land transformation and land occupation. Notably, switchgrass and corn stover also have negative values for effect on biodiversity due to land transformation. Wheat Straw and MSW have relatively higher values for water scarcity compared to their contributions to other categories, whereas corn stover and switchgrass have relatively higher values for particulate matter formation as compared to other categories. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.509,t=0.579,r=0.946,b=0.800), with ID bbfe3c09-af18-4ad2-ab72-e9c26e5ec15e -->

    – Wheat Straw (yellow)
    – MSW (black)
  • For most impact categories, Corn Dry Mill (blue) reaches 100% normalized contribution.
  • Other feedstocks show much lower contributions, with Switchgrass (green) and MSW (black) peaking in the Water scarcity category.
  • Some categories (e.g., Water scarcity) show higher contributions from Switchgrass and MSW, while others (e.g., Climate change, Fossil abiotic depletion) are dominated by Corn Dry Mill.

# Design Encodings :
  • Vertical bars for each feedstock within each impact category.
  • Distinct colours for each feedstock, as listed above.
  • Impact categories are listed along the x-axis, with labels rotated for readability.
  • Y-axis is normalized to the highest value per category (100%).

# Distribution & Trends :
  • Corn Dry Mill consistently has the highest normalized contribution (100%) across most impact categories.
  • Other feedstocks contribute minimally in most categories, except for Water scarcity, where Switchgrass and MSW have notable contributions.
  • Some categories show negative contributions for certain feedstocks.

# Analysis :
  • Corn Dry Mill is the dominant contributor to environmental impacts in most categories, except Water scarcity, where Switchgrass and MSW are more significant.
  • The normalization highlights the relative impact of each feedstock per category, revealing that alternative feedstocks generally have lower environmental impacts except in specific categories.
  • The figure suggests that switching from Corn Dry Mill to other feedstocks could reduce impacts in most categories, but may increase water scarcity concerns for some alternatives. <!-- figure, from page 4 (l=0.174,t=0.084,r=0.825,b=0.287), with ID 23b9fdef-d468-42c8-9b9b-5102ecd4b822 -->

Bioethanol production can be divided into three stages based on where the process is performed (shown in Figure 1): field, preprocessing/storage facility, and biorefinery facility. Field operations include feedstock cultivation and acquisition, preprocessing operations include steps that separate feedstock into a suitable form for processing, and biorefinery operations include the transportation of feedstock to the biorefinery and the refining process to produce bioethanol. Figure 3 shows the contribution of different stages of the process to the overall impact for all 6 feedstocks. The 18 impact categories compared in Figure 3 are the same as discussed in Figure 2 and Table 1. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.059,t=0.298,r=0.490,b=0.455), with ID cbc948f2-0ae8-4226-8101-7ea64fb9d6fc -->

For the first-generation feedstock, corn, for all categories (except land occupation and transformation), almost half of the impact is from field operations and the other half is from preprocessing operations. The biorefining facility itself contributes a very small amount to the overall impact of corn. Since all the processing of MSW happens only in the third stage, 100% of the impact of all categories is from the <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.060,t=0.456,r=0.490,b=0.558), with ID 3df600f1-0a16-4bf4-a30d-24ef16309f53 -->

biorefinery facility for MSW. Among the other second-
generation feedstocks, switchgrass and wheat straw have a very
small contribution from the field operations. Corn stover and
forest residue have a relatively higher contribution from field
operations, but the values are still lower than corn. Hence,
combining results from Table 1 and Figure 3, it can be observed
that the first-generation feedstock has the highest
environmental impact to produce bioethanol and the field
operations contribute a significant amount to the overall impact
for all the categories. However, the contribution from field,
preprocessing/storage facility, and biorefining facility is not
always as expected for first generation feedstocks. For
example, for freshwater eutrophication, land transformation,
and land occupation, second generation feedstocks, corn stover
and forest residue have equal or more impact from field than
first generation corn. It is crucial to understand the impact of
the feedstock in all the categories to have a holistic approach in
LCIA. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.511,t=0.299,r=0.941,b=0.557), with ID f7682dcc-1ef9-419a-8dcd-13e2ce4a7b1e -->

Summary : This figure presents a normalized comparison of the contributions of different feedstock stages (Field, Preprocessing/Storage Facility, Biorefining Facility) to various environmental impact categories, with each bar representing the highest value obtained for each impact category.

bar chart:
Title & Axes :
  • Title: "Normalized contribution of different feedstocks based on the highest value obtained for each impact category".
  • X-axis: Impact categories (e.g., Climate change - short term, Climate change - long term, Fossil and nuclear energy use, Mineral resources use, Photochemical oxidant formation, Ozone layer depletion, Freshwater ecotoxicity, Human toxicity - cancer, Human toxicity - non-cancer, Freshwater acidification, Terrestrial eutrophication, Marine eutrophication, Particulate matter formation, Ionizing radiation, Land transformation - biodiversity, Land occupation - biodiversity, Water scarcity).
  • Y-axis: Normalized contribution (%), ranging from 0% to 100% in 10% increments.
  • X-axis tick labels: Each impact category is listed with the feedstock type and stage (e.g., Corn stover - Field, Corn stover - Preprocessing/Storage Facility, Corn stover - Biorefining Facility, Switchgrass - Field, etc.).

Data Points :
  • For each impact category, three bars are shown:
    – Field (grey)
    – Preprocessing/Storage Facility (orange)
    – Biorefining Facility (blue)
  • Each bar’s height represents the normalized contribution (percentage) of that stage for the given impact category.
  • The highest value for each impact category is set to 100%, with other values scaled accordingly.

Design Encodings :
  • Bar colours: Grey (Field), Orange (Preprocessing/Storage Facility), Blue (Biorefining Facility).
  • Vertical bars grouped by impact category and feedstock/stage.
  • Gridlines at every 10% interval on the Y-axis.
  • No error bars or statistical annotations visible.

Distribution & Trends :
  • For most impact categories, the Biorefining Facility (blue) bars are the tallest, often reaching 100%.
  • Field (grey) and Preprocessing/Storage Facility (orange) bars vary in height, with some categories showing significant contributions from the Field stage.
  • Some impact categories (e.g., Land transformation, Land occupation, Water scarcity) show higher contributions from the Field stage.

Analysis :
  • The Biorefining Facility stage is the dominant contributor for the majority of environmental impact categories, especially for climate change, fossil energy use, and toxicity-related impacts.
  • The Field stage is most significant for land-related impacts and water scarcity.
  • The Preprocessing/Storage Facility stage generally has lower contributions across most categories.
  • The figure enables direct comparison of which feedstock stage is most responsible for each environmental impact, highlighting the importance of targeting the Biorefining Facility for mitigation in most categories, but the Field stage for land and water impacts. <!-- figure, from page 4 (l=0.065,t=0.562,r=0.938,b=0.737), with ID b1aea05a-87df-4d91-85bc-60f6a9c4bb6e -->

5. Conclusions

    A comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was conducted to produce bioethanol from six different first and second-generation feedstocks. The impact assessment was done for eighteen impact categories that influence ecosystem quality, human health, and resources. The LCA was done at a global production to quantify the overall impact of these feedstocks without restrictions on the location. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.059,t=0.750,r=0.490,b=0.878), with ID cfa3d8d2-1d32-4b60-a708-df4faa7c0960 -->

The results of the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) indicated that the highest impact in all the categories is from the production of bioethanol from first-generation feedstock, corn. A significant portion of this impact was found to be <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.060,t=0.879,r=0.490,b=0.937), with ID b0a2ad5d-8a37-4713-93d3-486ba85edbbb -->

contributed by the field operations (feedstock cultivation and
acquisition). Hence, using first-generation feedstocks to
produce ethanol significantly affects ecosystem quality, human
health, and resource depletion. Municipal Solid Waste (MSW)
was found to have the least impact in most of the categories and
also had negative values for the impact on biodiversity and
freshwater eutrophication. Production of bioethanol from
MSW also has byproducts formed (such as surplus electricity,
heat, and water) which contribute significantly to the reduction
of the environmental impact as they make the overall process
circular (majority of the resources needed are produced as
byproducts in the same process). <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.511,t=0.751,r=0.941,b=0.923), with ID 14e11ae0-04da-4b0d-bf15-0cd189b615ff -->

In summary, it can be concluded that to produce bioethanol, overall second-generation feedstocks have an advantage over first-generation feedstocks in terms of environmental impact. For the extension of this study, we plan to analyze the impacts of more first, second, and third-generation feedstocks and do a more detailed LCIA and analyze how bioethanol would contribute in reducing environmental impact of transportation sector. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.058,t=0.083,r=0.492,b=0.202), with ID 1b2aa726-8825-43c4-b8e9-44ee1aca6b69 -->
